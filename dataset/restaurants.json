On the upper and lower floors, I went upstairs to see it, and it was ventilated on all sides, so I still hid in the glass room downstairs because there was air conditioning inside. The chef is a Khmer, of course, the authentic Khmer cuisine, of course, is also a bit of Western cuisine style, overall it is quite exquisite. The weather is hot and the smoothie must be used to cool down. I chose a special lychee mint smoothie. The green color looks refreshing and the taste is very fresh. The smoothie is very delicate. The mint leaves are all broken, blending the sweetness of lychee. The dishes were ordered by a friend. From the previous dish to the staple food, there were basically shrimps in it. It was very repeated that I didn&#39;t eat, and there were many practices for shrimp. For example, the mango color of the fore dish, I cut the shreds with carrot shreds and grilled shrimp, the juice is full and the taste is fresh. The product is a more integrated, smoked fish silk, and a small quail egg. Pour into the soup, there is a sweet and sour taste of citrus, people can&#39;t help but drink several mouths, quite authentic Southeast Asian flavor. Pepper shrimp Kampo pepper to enhance the flavor, and salmon, the sauce is quite strong, slightly spicy. Then the dessert, Kajuda pumpkin, and the fresh milk papaya frozen look similar, not very sweet, quite dense. The service is more appropriate and cost-effective.",

It is relatively rare for this restaurant to charge 10% tax and 10% service fee, but it is acceptable to calculate the per capita of about 140 yuan. Seafood pineapple salad (seafood with pineapple salad) with pineapple, salmon, shrimp, etc., tastes good. The best and most amazing thing is the mango glutinous rice (mango and sticky rice), the soft glutinous rice plus the sweetness of the mango, and then match their sauce, eat a bite, can&#39;t help but shout out a 666.

We just opened the door when we arrived, and there was a waiter cleaning inside. The front desk clerk let us rest in the sofa area at the door and brought the menu. The waiter also looked more Western-style and more decent than other restaurants. The table is lined with fine cutlery and various wine glasses, which is difficult to see in other restaurants in Siem Reap. After the meal is set, there will be two snacks before the meal, including banana dried and toast. The banana is simply but not hard. The bread is well baked with butter. The three of us ate two plates of bread (bread can be unlimited, the waiter will automatically give you another copy if you see that you eat faster. ) Because there was no wine, the wine glass was then removed to make the table more tidy and generous. The pre-dinner was very appetizing, with salmon with spices, lemons, etc., and the taste was enhanced. The salmon grilled skin of the dinner is crispy and enjoyable, but the middle part is basically not grilled, or raw, not very good with the outer fish to form a unified taste, a little regret. The steak was ordered by Australian cattle this time, but it felt not as good as Cambodian local beef. This Australian beef tendon is not very good at knifed and chewed, affecting the feeling of food in the mouth. The pasta is not very good but it is also average. The tomato soup is amazing, with butter and cream, the color is more gorgeous and full and the sour taste is not very strong. It is better to go before dinner. The dessert is roasted apples, and the roasted apples are very close to the appearance of the barbecue. The details are useful to clean the table and change the plate with a small brush before serving the dessert. Finally, a comment will be given to the guest so that they can fill in any suggestions. Overall, the decoration should be the most luxurious in Siem Reap restaurants, and the service level is very high and meticulous. If some meals are carefully studied and cooked, it will be closer to perfection.",

Several local children in Little Angkor picked up food discarded by tourists from the trash can, and bread became a food in their eyes. Compared with the domestic picky children, they felt a lot. On the return trip, Lee, the driver, invited us to his house. I saw the familiar Haier refrigerator. His wife sent freshly picked coconut to drink, cool and sweet. Lee lived with his parents and brothers, like the fourth generation of China, and was happy. Give his four-year-old son two toys a little thanks. Back to the hotel near 3 o&#39;clock, choose the nearest restaurant to solve lunch. Traditional Cambodian meal amok, BBQ pizza, salad. Suddenly remembered today, eating a spring roll should be the scene. Chanrey Tree is a net red shop where Beckham has visited to experience authentic Khmer cuisine, dark and quiet. Wet wipes and banana slices, sweet and soft mango glutinous rice and coconut icecream before the meal. Affordable for 10% service charge and 10% tip.",

At around 6 pm, the security guard at the entrance of the restaurant was very enthusiastic, and he also called us ToTo car with an umbrella. The meal came to order dessert banana slices, disinfected towels to wipe hands, and the service was very intimate! There are not many varieties of dishes on the menu, but they are very similar to our stomach! The second big and the small seem to be more, the first seafood green curry, the soup is very fresh, with Cambodian rice, you can definitely eat two bowls, the seafood is also very fresh! Fried seafood and spring rolls are second, the spring coupons are a bit more spices, no Saigon mother&#39;s delicious! Mango glutinous rice, no Thai delicious, too sweet, glutinous rice on plantains, eating the second bite is tired! Dongli Sahu fish, a very light dish, generally! Beef skewers, recommended by the waiter, although a bit old, but the taste is very fragrant, the whole stomach is round in the end, the overall is still very good! This home has a service fee, tax, a total of 70 knives! The price is good!",

While leading us in, I carefully instructed us many times to pay attention to the steps. The restaurant&#39;s decoration style is prominent, antique but permeates the romantic atmosphere. There is only a ceiling fan on the first floor, and there is air conditioning on the second floor along the winding stairs. The distance between the dining table and the dining table is very close, which makes people feel like a table with strangers. There is no card seat and no box. As a restaurant with Southeast Asian tastes, the Chinese and Cambodian cuisines are integrated, with a delicate and layered taste, which makes people enjoy the taste buds. However, the dishes are single and lack innovation. I ate several restaurants of the same type, and the menus were highly similar. Ordered a glass of Mojito, no alcohol at all",

The taste of spring rolls is very local, with a variety of vegetables in it, and you will feel very refreshing when you bite it. Curry beef is the first choice for people who love curry. The curry is extremely rich and the beef tastes very moderate. Finally, call a big coconut, pour ice cubes inside, and drink a sip is a paradise on earth [Yun Sai]",

The service attitude of this store is very good, it is the front desk staff of the hotel who recommended us to eat. The portion of the dishes is not very large. Generally, I order three dishes with my mother. The first night, I ordered a coconut green 2 knife, which was not sweet at all. Amok fish 5.5 knife, which was very popular with my mother and I. It was very delicious. Deep fried pork ribs 5 knife, too dry and too wood! Beef fried toncai 4.5 knife, how can the toncai be sticked. But the taste is still OK! Later, I packed a fresh spring roll 2.5 knife, and the coriander inside was still well received. The second time I went there to eat, we were going to make a plane and there were not many people to eat that afternoon. I felt that there were a lot of vacancies if we went to eat in the afternoon. We ordered a mango shake, 1.5 knife, very general \uff5e a bamboo shoot coconut milk soup 4.5 knife. Chicken vegetable soup white noodles 4.5 knife. Cash fried shrimp 4.5 knife. Seafood fried yellow noodles 4.5 knife. Fried rice 4.5 knife. If you feel it, if you eat more people, you can try different dishes. Ordering a little more cooking is more like if we order those noodle soups and fried noodles like this, the price is not so high, but in general the taste is still very good, very in line with our taste. Recommend you to take friends. The restaurant seems to be unable to make an appointment. When I went to a place, I went up to eat. There were two floors and the waiter&#39;s attitude was very good. But you will repeat the menu with you after you order the food. And free food. And there is no service fee, of course, if you feel good, you can tip.",

The open restaurant has no air conditioning, and it is the old-fashioned ceiling fan on the top of the head. 4-6 The location of the person, the table is covered with red and white tablecloths. The waiter will be simple Chinese, the restaurant mainly operates Cambodian dishes and some Thai dishes, order barbecue pork ribs, fried spring rolls, Amok, Khmer fried rice, Dongyin Gong soup, fried hollow vegetables, white rice is free, Amok can choose pork, chicken, seafood and other side dishes. Everyone chose Mojito for the drink. Generally speaking, I prefer the style of Cambodian cuisine. It is not as spicy as Thai cuisine, with a little sweetness, and there are not many spices. The price of the main dish is basically in 4-5 US dollars. If there are many people, the per capita can be full of 8 or 9 US dollars. The price is still very high.",

There were still many Asians! I ordered the signboard, because I was drinking a mango shake bought on the street next door, and the waiter politely said that I could not drink take-out. This was a bit mandatory! After a while, the dishes came up one after another, Vietnamese spring rolls, stuffing vegetables, the taste was average! The bibimbap soup of aock fish and curry chicken is very good, it looks a bit messy, but the taste is good! The fried fish is very crisp and the fish is not fishy, but if you wait in line for a long time, it is not necessary to wait for this home, and the Khmer dishes in other homes are similar to this taste! Finally pay the bill 21.5 knife!",

We ordered &quot;white spring rolls&quot;, cold skin spring rolls, also called Vietnamese spring rolls, in fact, is a vegetable roll, very delicious, recommended, Khmer kitchen is good at making fish, so their tableware pattern is also fish, every dish, such as you want a curry or something, and then provide fish, chicken, beef for you to choose, For example, if you want a tofu, it also has three side dishes for you to choose, most of us choose fish, as if only the same choice of chicken. AMOK fish, is their national dish, must taste it, curry is also oh, we ordered a soup, the soup base has many shelled shrimp, Taste good, recommended. In general, Cambodian dishes have more spices, and some spices are still more spicy. Be sure to taste their drinks. We called mango and lime. This drink is very common in Siem Reap. I forgot in English. Translated to mean &quot;shake a shake&quot;, mellow and sweet, Cambodian drinks are a little good, that is, the sweetness is moderate, indicating that Cambodia was a sugar-rich people in ancient times, no sugar shortage (brown sugar is their specialty) unlike Europeans, before not sugar, super sweet taste, Candy and desserts are sweet. Pay $36. As we leave, the waiter will put his hands together on his chest to make a thank you.",

The restaurant is divided into indoor and outdoor dining areas, even if the weather is hot, foreigners like to sit outside. The entrance is the restaurant&#39;s store of the same name, selling some souvenirs and clothing. The indoor part is divided into two floors, the first floor is the dining area, and the second floor is displayed with some rock singer souvenirs. If you like, you can go up and take pictures. Ordered some of their signature dishes, cheeseburger, western cold steak, salted salmon, salad, and half a portion of brownies. The feature of the American restaurant is that the amount is large, the steak is 5 minutes cooked, just right. The most recommended thing is to mention the drink, Groupie Grind, Mango Berry Code, Mango Tango taste good. Although the restaurant charges a service fee of 10 [%], it is still quite worth it overall. The waiters are young people, very enthusiastic and attentive. From the beginning of the order, they will recommend suitable dishes for customers. The bar waiter will play some fancy bartending from time to time, accompanied by the rock music of the live band, which is a very good dining experience!",

        "comment": "#Gourmet Forest#HardRock|Eat an authentic American meal in Siem Reap This is a rock-themed restaurant with authentic American dining, right next to King&#39;s Road, with a huge guitar at the door, which is quite striking. A major feature of American cuisine is the weight, The taste is popular and accepted. If you are tired of eating Cambodian food everywhere, you may as well come here to eat a gourmet meal for a change. The restaurant is divided into two indoor and outdoor areas. There are two floors in the room. When there are no guests upstairs, the air conditioner will not be turned on. I went up to watch the signature guitar and I was sweating for three minutes. The biggest feature of the big electric guitar shape is that the lively resident band performance stage will be set up along the street every night. When the band performs, basically a sound can be heard on the road. Despite the hot weather, European and American guests like to sit in the dining area next to the stage to enjoy the restaurant&#39;s special performance. However, sitting in the outdoor area may miss the wonderful indoors. The whole row at the entrance of the restaurant is a row of drums used by well-known drummers. The interior walls are decorated with a considerable number of signature guitars by rock stars, all favorites of rock fans. This is the entrance to the restaurant, which is quite inconspicuous compared to the stage where the band performs. The whole wall is a drum used by well-known band drummers. STING signature guitar \ud83c\udfb8 foreigners like it. Sitting outside, hiding indoors to enjoy the air conditioning, we have become an alternative, but there is also a feeling of private, the waiters are particularly enthusiastic, several times to ask how the taste of the dish is, like it, happy...\ud83d\ude44 Let you think the 10% service fee is too worth it. Next to the table is the performance suit worn by Latin Queen Shakira. The last wc encountered David Bowie&#39;s signature poster! Through the large glass window is the restaurant&#39;s joint store, watching a whole row of pandas roll in a good mood. Up to the second floor, because no guests can rest assured to pat, the wall is densely hung with a dozen rock celebrity used or signed guitars. This belt was worn by Elvis, hidden in the second floor, and missed. The cheeseburger is quite big, the beef is very tender and the water is very sufficient, and it can be shared by two girls. The Xileng steak is also recommended by the waiter. If you are conservative, order a medium five-point ripe, the entrance is very fresh, and the mashed potatoes are quite American. The restaurant offers a rich selection of wines and non-alcoholic drinks, which taste good and can meet the different needs of guests. Only this cup is an alcoholic drink, but the sweet and delicious drink looks more like a smoothie drink, called Groupie Grind, sour and sweet, in such a hot place, I really want to drink it. Mongo Tango, a thick, freshly squeezed mango juice jumps on the tip of the tongue to a tropical tango. Cob salad, a large portion, full of avocado, bacon, smoked chicken, and crisp vegetables, both in favor of vegetables and meat eaters. Drizzle with mayonnaise and cold steak! Five points are just right, very good to cut, the entrance is fat but not greasy, recommended. Roasted salmon is quite satisfactory. I am afraid that there is always a little fatty in the fish belly. I will habitually pour a little lemon juice. The entrance is still amazing. It is tender and has a little fatty taste but not greasy. I didn&#39;t worry about overcooking, the meat turned woody. In fact, I prefer the crispy chips, which may be my favorite dish in the old beauty food. Haha iced fire brownie? I think it&#39;s okay to call it this. A thick brownie is a coriander ice cream ball. Then pour the hot cream, the entrance layer is rich, and the ice cream also removes the cream&#39;s easy-to-greasy taste. After eating the big meal, go to the store next door. The clerk in this store brought a long string of pins. I didn&#39;t expect that there was a guitar shape made with pins in the store. Quite forgetting your rock theme. Under the ceiling is a pair of shoes that Eminem wears. In the store, I also found a nine-inch nailed Rezeno guitar! !",

There are not many people. The location is very empty. You can order a platter. There is a little bit. Add a white rice. The salad is very good. There are a lot of shrimp meat.

The whole restaurant and wallpaper are full of strong local customs. The service of the restaurant is also very warm. The restaurant is named after a traditional Khmer dish, Amok is a traditional Cambodian cuisine wrapped in leaves with fish, chicken or beef, plus spices such as coconut milk, curry powder, turmeric powder, lemongrass and steamed. It was a big one, and the plate was very particular. Different amork had different flags on it. A small portion of rice will be equipped next to it, so as not to be too greasy. amork is a typical Khmer dish, the taste of various spices is not small and fresh, but it is not spicy. We also ordered classic Cambodia Discovery, with spring rolls, rice, and some local spices like sauces and soups. Personally prefer salty and sweet, so they are acceptable. The price will be a little more expensive than the average, about 25-30 knife, you can pay US dollars.",

The restaurant waiter will speak English, have a beer, and unexpectedly sent us corn juice, I don&#39;t know why to send, anyway, we received it, very good, very strong corn juice. The platter here is very interesting. There is a small flag inserted on it to tell what meat is. In fact, the meat is all crushed meat. Cambodia&#39;s beef is old and others are OK. The last order of the sand ice platter has 5 flavors, sweet and sour, quite refreshing.

In fact, they have a single meal, there is a recommendation on the desktop, I found out after I ordered it, I quickly changed it, otherwise I would spend more than $10+, that is, the waiter would not really recommend it in order to make money, because they charge 10 [%] service fee. Hard service fee, their service is also very rigid, I think the Khmer restaurant next door is better than them. Amok is the whole environment is beautiful. Besides the taste: Amok tastes good, the other dishes in the package are just once, and it will feel very salty after eating, resulting in the taste of amok later. The drink was ordered the cheapest coconut juice -green coconut, very stale, the skin is yellow, the water inside also feels sour, although it is the cheapest, but with this stale, it is really not easy to drink, really can&#39;t drink.

The proprietress should be called Sara, I remember her name when I went, she was very happy. But fortunately, the email is booked, as long as you write it down for the TuTu driver to see it, it will be no problem, and it will definitely be brought to the right place. Because the restaurant is near the night market and the old market. Because it was the dinner that was played on the first day, I booked a little late at 19:30. We arrived at the restaurant on time, and there were already people in line. Fortunately, we booked a place because the restaurant in the scenic spot was unpalatable during the day. Shock arrived, thinking that the local restaurants in Siem Reap were expensive and unpalatable. Because it is poor there, the chickens and cattle seen on the road are very thin, so the beef lok lak (a fried beef practice) ordered in the scenic spot is super unpalatable and can&#39;t be chewed. The chicken is also very old, and then Amok (a local curry) is clear soup and water. I was also hesitant when I ordered at Haven, afraid and disappointed. But this worry was quickly covered by the hunger of tired and hungry all day. Everyone still ordered the recommended dishes on the review website. I didn&#39;t hesitate at all. I thought: It&#39;s not a big deal. I won&#39;t order it next time. Then after ordering the food, I read other people&#39;s comments several times to reassure myself; P fortunately, the result did not disappoint me. This is simply a world. #Caesar salad# Not much to say, supplement the vegetable nutrition, but when growing this heart egg is very delicious, the yolk is just cooked, everyone is rushing to eat. The salad sauce is also very good. #Dongyingong Seafood Soup# There are a lot of things, it doesn&#39;t seem to be very spicy, I have eaten it anyway. #fried salmon#Because it is not by the beach, it seems that the seafood in Siem Reap can only be obtained. I am entangled in fried very fragrant and the dip is delicious. #chicken Amok# This is called Amok, okay? Curry is fresh and sweet, and it is not the same as Thai curry, anyway, empty plate. #Beef Lok Lak# This is really conscience, a full plate of fried beef and a poached egg are balanced, the beef is a small beef slice, not too tender, but the taste is good. #ChickenLaska# This is generally not recommended, far worse than Malaysia. #Qingjiang pasta# This is afraid that we will not be full, but the ending is the same sweep, the strength of the 4 women is infinite. Of course, I think the taste of Qingjiang is a little lighter, far from Pietite George , but my friends feel delicious. #Special pork ribs#Very special taste, of course I love grilled ribs more, not bad, the vegetables are delicious. The last empty plate proves everything. . . Everyone saw that basically every staple food was served, so there was no need to order another meal. At the same time, I thought that it would cost 50 cents a person to eat in the scenic restaurant during the day. It was really cheating. The drink was ordered with passion fruit juice, which was also very delicious. The local water treatment is not good, it is not recommended to ice products, but it is too hot over there, we have not resisted, but fortunately, there is no diarrhea in the end, bottled water is always available. Finally, I paid $69, and 113 yuan per person, the conscience of the industry.",

But in Siem Reap, I was too busy to book in advance. That night, our group of five people took the tutu car directly, and the restaurant was a little bit biased. However, it may be that the wine is not afraid of the deep alley, and many guests are still dining. When the restaurant manager asked if we had a reservation, we replied no (I guess they should have prepared the daily amount of food according to the reservation, if they are not booked, it is estimated that the food in reserve will not be too sufficient). But he was very nice and invited us to dinner after communicating with the chef! A lot of dishes are delicious! The taste is great and the waiter is very polite. I went at night so I didn&#39;t see the big environment of the restaurant too clearly, but there was a small yard in the semi-open two-story building, full of green plants, sitting by the window eating food and blowing the breeze to chat with friends, it was so pleasant! Recommend the dishes to see the picture, every one is recommended! Remember to book in advance.",

Cool, although I don&#39;t know which is a banana flower, the silky thing is like the taste of papaya... There is roasted shredded chicken in the middle. Very good appetizer. Pumpkin burger. The friends like it very much. The faint pumpkin is sweet, with pumpkin shredded in the middle, with tomatoes and greens. The burger&#39;s bread is slightly dry. Spring rolls. Since eating spring rolls from Vietnam for a week, I have no interest in all kinds of things. This time too. Everyone likes it. Vegetable spring rolls, various vegetable silks, and purple sour are placed in them to highlight their taste. There is no seasoning, and you need to dip in juice to have a taste change. Cheesecake, cheese is slightly dry. Come out to eat without hypocrisy, just feel it.",

I have also eaten a restaurant that tastes amazing in China, but the overall is good. \uff5e Amok&#39;s fish can also be recommended by many reviews. It is very good. I just want to recommend it. Salad haha organic vegetables taste good, such as Caesar salad... The boss Sarah is very nice, and she started to go to her hospitality. We exchanged with her several times until the waiter who called at the checkout was her own to find money for us. She said that she and her husband had been to China ten years ago and liked it very much. When China finally left, she told her that she hoped that one day you could come to China again. She said that China must be a very friendly country. After all, China is a very friendly country. I also hope to see us here to eat next time. In order to affirm the thoughtful service of the waiter, we also gave a tip, although we saw a lot of old people. There is no tip outside haha \uff5e If you book, QQ mailbox is very convenient. Spicy chicken gmail location is not very easy to find, but the average tutu driver knows that we started to take tutu to the old market and wanted to walk there by ourselves because it was about 20 minutes. Later, there were too many forks. Although I asked the locals, I was still a little dizzy. The motorcycle driven by a little girl behind took us there. It was really kind to the locals. \u2764\ufe0f",

The green mango salad was served with dried fish from Lake Donglisa, which improved the flavor of the whole dish. Amok has a higher cotton kitchen, which tastes more rich and has a aftertaste. It is the most delicious dish on this trip. Seeing Dongyin Gong, the favorite of good friends, Haven&#39;s soup base obviously took time to boil. It is estimated that his Amok will be so delicious and related to it. The fried spring rolls are won in the marinade. To be honest, the spring rolls themselves are not delicious. I still prefer to eat the fried pork stuffing with cabbage. The above 4 dishes, plus drinks total $25, is fair. The new place where the restaurant is moved is far from the old market and bar street where the restaurant is located, but so there are a few more tranquil and cozy. There are courtyards and small buildings, which are quite petty.",

The dishes have Western-style light meals and Khmer dishes, and the waiters are more enthusiastic. Fish and chips are more British dishes. It seems that there should be more European and American customers, so the taste is OK, the fish is bigger, and the fish will not be particularly fishy. Like chips, just pick up ketchup. The double burger is enough. The beef patties are very thick or double-layered, cheese, cucumber, lettuce, tomato sauce, and it is more satisfying to eat when you are hungry. Khmer vegetables ordered a classic amok, and they ate with the locals. He said that the taste was very positive, and I thought it was okay. Put it in a small jar, it is fish, curry, coconut milk, and the taste of citrus is not bad. After that, I ordered a dessert called ginger bree, French dessert, a faint ginger flavor, with a thick layer of caramel on it. Not particularly cheap, but there is a 20% discount at noon.

The cold noodles of cheese are really a must in midsummer, with half-cooked eggs, yolks mixed with cheese, don&#39;t have a flavor, very distinctive. The only drawback is probably mango, I have eaten a few, found that the taste of mango is not very good, neither sour nor sweet, maybe Cambodian mango is not as good as Thailand...

It is to eat Southeast Asian spices that can&#39;t be arranged in a nine-square grid, and the chef has a hand in ingredients. The pre-course was a popular dish, and the freshly fried scallops from Sihanouk were super tender. The unique thing was that they were made of Cambodian special Kampot pepper, which was protected by the EU, and the fresh garlic. The Kampo stone crab made of red curry is a big dish. The sauce is superb on the rice. The blend of coconut milk will not be so washed. The crab meat is full. Special crab tongs and lemonade for hand washing are provided. The hollow cabbage is almost not spicy, and very clear vegetables such as butter are used. There are four options for desserts, malis mousse and announced pepper buds, prefer the latter, blending local spices, ice cream with jasmine flavor is very fresh.

If you have any prejudice against Cambodian food before, you will feel that you have eaten it all fake after eating Malis. This salad is made with crisp fried noodles with pork pickled in lemongrass and slow-cooked in coconut milk. This taste is very rich and appetizing.

After sitting, there are welcome mango snow bar! The pre-course was a popular dish, and the freshly fried scallops from Sihanouk were super tender. The unique thing was that they were made of Cambodian special Kampot pepper, which was protected by the EU, and the fresh garlic. The Kampo stone crab made of red curry is a big dish. The sauce is superb on the rice. The blend of coconut milk will not be so washed. The crab meat is full. Special crab tongs and lemonade for hand washing are provided. The hollow cabbage is almost not spicy, and very clear vegetables such as butter are used. There are four options for desserts, malis mousse and kambu pepper buds, prefer the latter, blending local spices, ice cream has a very fresh taste of jasmine. The drink has a clear coconut juice, very original!",

There is a promotional sign for a beautiful knife and a cup of coffee at the door. Although there is a summer thunderstorm, the weather in Siem Reap is still sultry at noon. I can&rsquo;t think of the affordable price of the old house. With indoor air conditioning, It&#39;s really a big joy, it&#39;s not difficult to imagine the lively scene during the peak season. At the beginning, the package was really super cheap, but the a meal and b meal were not included in the Lok lac, because I came here, so I scattered decisively. [Not simple ]Fresh Spring Roll $2.5 [not simple] I have reservations about this fresh spring roll. Who let me just eat an unparalleled spring roll before, there is no comparability, of course, including the price. The spring roll is slightly hard, and there is a strange smell when chewed carefully. There is a little shrimp inside (really only a little), sandwiched with cucumber silk, radish silk, lettuce, and it seems to have citrus, filled very full, but also too tight, the whole mouth is hard, rough, no gentle feeling, and the sauce is not impressive. [Not simple ]beef loklac $5.25[not simple] The second reservation is actually a star product. . . In fact, I am also very entangled. I watched the &quot;beef slices&quot; for a long time. I chewed and watched and chewed. I finally had to wonder. Is it a second brother? ! To be, or not to be, that is the question. To be honest, if it is pork, forget it, because the sauce is very good, sweet, a bit Cantonese, and the Chinese will sell it. I like one side fried eggs, flowing egg yolks, bibimbap second light rice, and 100 fries with the rice are Mai Kee flavor. [Smile ]khmer cafe One yuan coffee [smile] In addition to being sweet, there is nothing to be picky [smile ]crispy calamary $3.85 [smile] This eel circle is praised, the weight is super large, crisp, dry, fried powder hangs a little more, salad sauce is salad sauce. [Smile ]sticky rice mango $1.65[Smile] Mango glutinous rice on the street, this platter is quite thoughtful, the coconut milk tastes sweet, the rice grains are soft, the mango is slightly thinner, the thickness is lacking, and the overall look is not bad.

There is a promotional sign for a beautiful knife and a cup of coffee at the door. Although there is a summer thunderstorm, the weather in Siem Reap is still sultry at noon. I can&rsquo;t think of the affordable price of the old house. With indoor air conditioning, It&#39;s really a big joy, it&#39;s not difficult to imagine the lively scene during the peak season. At the beginning, the package was really super cheap, but the a meal and b meal were not included in the Lok lac, because I came here, so I scattered decisively. [Not simple ]Fresh Spring Roll $2.5 [not simple] I have reservations about this fresh spring roll. Who let me just eat an unparalleled spring roll before, there is no comparability, of course, including the price. The spring roll is slightly hard, and there is a strange smell when chewed carefully. There is a little shrimp inside (really only a little), sandwiched with cucumber silk, radish silk, lettuce, and it seems to have citrus, filled very full, but also too tight, the whole mouth is hard, rough, no gentle feeling, and the sauce is not impressive. [Not simple ]beef loklac $5.25[not simple] The second reservation is actually a star product. . . In fact, I am also very entangled. I watched the &quot;beef slices&quot; for a long time. I chewed and watched and chewed. I finally had to wonder. Is it a second brother? ! To be, or not to be, that is the question. To be honest, if it is pork, forget it, because the sauce is very good, sweet, a bit Cantonese, and the Chinese will sell it. I like one side fried eggs, flowing egg yolks, bibimbap second light rice, and 100 fries with the rice are Mai Kee flavor. [Smile ]khmer cafe One yuan coffee [smile] In addition to being sweet, there is nothing to be picky [smile ]crispy calamary $3.85 [smile] This eel circle is praised, the weight is super large, crisp, dry, fried powder hangs a little more, salad sauce is salad sauce. [Smile ]sticky rice mango $1.65[Smile] Mango glutinous rice on the street, this platter is quite thoughtful, the coconut milk tastes sweet, the rice grains are soft, the mango is slightly thinner, the thickness is lacking, and the overall look is not bad. []soda water $1.1[] A restaurant followed by a trial, It is the soda that is supported by soda. The same soda, I have bought it from 1 knife to 6 knife. The price of this soft drink is really affordable.",

Every dish is unexpectedly delicious and special. For example, we have never tried cuppacino mushroom sauce. The appetizers before main course are also very special. Great experience!

As soon as I pushed the door in, the Embassy restaurant revealed the elegant and noble environment that made me feel good. The restaurant will launch different dinner packages every month. A package with a tax price of about $30 seems a bit expensive, but you can eat 7 exquisite appetizers, main dishes, soups, desserts, etc. like artwork. I personally think it is worth a try! Each dish, the waiter will clean up the table for you, set the dishes, and introduce you to the materials and practices of the dish. Every dish is not eaten from time to time, dragon mustard, banana flowers, lychee, petals, both add beauty and bring a fresh taste to the taste buds. Each dish will blend Western food with the characteristics of Chinese food and Khmer cuisine, and collide with sparks, completely touching the tip of the tongue. Each dish, whether it is an appetizer, main course or dessert, will appear at the right time in turn, and work together to perform a wonderful food drama.

The meat is inserted with the icon when serving, and it is clear at a glance. There are also eggs, lard, vegetables and pasta, absolutely full, and drinks are counted. The waiter will try it at the beginning, and then he will bake it himself. Be careful not to burn it. Cambodian BBQ stove is more distinctive, is a medium high and low pot, the middle protrusion is applied with lard after barbecue, the surrounding grooves are added to the chicken soup to cook vegetables and noodles. Since it is integrated, the only drawback is that the middle protrusion part is quickly blackened after roasting.",

The restaurant has a 10% tax, there is no Chinese menu and the waiter can only speak English (btw, I don&#39;t know if it is an accident, the English of the waiter who serves us is relatively poor. .

The menu will be changed every two weeks to keep the ingredients fresh and ensure better production. The five-course and six-course packages are $27 and $31 respectively. The difference is that there is one more meal. Two menus are optional. First on a side dish, then menu1 is a boneless bullfrog meat, the selection of bullfrog legs, mixed with peanuts, vanilla, lotus root, frog meat to fishy fresh and tender, elastic flesh, and the ingredients are just right. menu2 is a pan-fried fish meat, handled very well, although slightly greasy but no fishy, crispy meat on a fresh fish pad with a crispy radish cake, with Chinese spices, leeks, sesame and pickled radish. The French chef of cuscine wat has been in Siem Reap for 13 years, and the integration of local meals is very clever and innovative. The grilled fish wrapped in Gaoliang ginger leaves, the fish has been treated very tender, plus the fragrance of Gaoliang ginger leaves, the taste is more special. The pork is served with a vegetable salad. This dish mixes the pork with fresh Kambu pepper, then adds herbs and leaves, and puts it in a small glass cup, plus a small plate of vegetable salad. The pork is hot and in place. It tastes strong in broth and retains the deliciousness of the meat. After that, the soup, wild mushroom soup with shrimp, choose the cooked shrimp and mushroom combination, mixed horse-toothed, tamarind, and some shrimp sauce condiments, the color of the table is very good, the plate adds appetite, the fresh sweetness of the shrimp meat is retained, the soup is refreshing. Dining outside in a darker place, so the green papaya beef face broth served up looks not so ok. I tasted it. There are dumplings and local vanilla flavors. The overall impression is not particularly deep. The staple food is hand-teared pork ribs with cereal, egg yolk, bean sprouts and cabbage, the meat is thinner and the taste is tender; Another staple food is shrimp-based, curry Kung River prawns with lemon basil, pumpkin fruit and leaves bottom, tamarind seedlings as embellishment, set the plate naturally good-looking, shrimp meat has a obsession I naturally love this one, roasted shrimp meat adds fragrance, The chopped pumpkins are served together, and the shrimps are sweet and delicious. When eight points full, dessert, the first to win the value, lemon smoothie with cantaloupe cold soup, choose the chopped cantaloupe simmer cold soup base, add a lemon basil smoothie ball on it, and then use lemon protein paste dotted on the smoothie ball, the taste is of course sweet and sour, Sour and sweet, full of fragrance, it is best to eat lemon in the evening on a hot summer day like Siem Reap. Another caramel mango pie, coconut juice blended with brownies, and passionfruit taste, the chef finally came out to exchange some, roughly introduced the next dish, and sent a mini fruit platter to end the exquisite dining experience. Drinks need a single point, since it is the hottest online red store in Siem Reap, naturally there is its own specialty, don&#39;t miss it.",

        "comment": "I wrote the email and no one returned. When I saw the website booking, I saw that the online red store was full. When was Siem Reap&#39;s dining so hot? This is my eighth meal of the day, so after eating G&#39;s house, I remember to wear a dark trail, but I am not familiar with the place, a little square, or around a gray avenue, and passed some places like a vegetable market, all small merchants and hawkers. It was already dark at around 8 o&#39;clock and I couldn&#39;t see the far road. After arriving, the logo at the door showed that I walked into a small garden and asked the waiter to wait a long time, what? Because there is still a ninth house, so I can&#39;t wait here, but I am very upset that I can&#39;t eat it. At this time, the Chef went downstairs and then asked the situation. I said if I could pack it and take it away. He must have a few horses in his heart, and the answer is of course not, because it is similar to fine dining. But in the end, it was okay. I waited for about 10 minutes. The indoor seat could not be seated. It could only be outdoor. There were flowers and plants around. However, I probably applied some anti-mosquito liquid. I didn&#39;t get bitten when I left, but there were still insects. Who called it a garden? The outdoor lighting is dim, I envy the people who eat inside, there is air conditioning, I only have big fans. There are more white people. The menu here is very simple, there are 5courses and 6courses, 27 knives and 31 knives, and the rhythm of the menu is changed once in 2 weeks, so if you go to eat, it is likely that it is different from what I eat. Since it is a Set, don&#39;t think about it. 31 knives for me quickly. Remember that there is bullfrog meat, a frog leg, there are lotus root, peanuts, vanilla, etc., the ingredients are quite rich, I am used to Sichuan&#39;s spicy frog legs, and it is good to taste different French flavors. The skin is quite crisp, I didn&#39;t look carefully at what fish it was, and I couldn&#39;t eat any taste when I caught a cold. It was served with vegetables and pickled radishes, etc., which was a fishy one! I like a stewed pork, I don&#39;t like to eat the general pork, this taste is very special, because the most famous Kambu pepper here, the blue pepper with some herbs, the gravy in the pork is very fragrant, the stew is also quite simmering, the amount is just right. Green papaya beef face broth and wild mushroom shrimp soup, or like the latter, the outdoor is dark, it looks like the color of the dish is discounted, the seafood soup has tamarind and some shrimp sauce, the taste is more layered, relatively beef face meat is better. A lot. The staple food also has pork, but ribs, mixed with bean sprouts and cabbage and cereal, and the meat is relatively tender and slow-cooked. There is also a shrimp, staple food or less heavy shrimp, Mekong prawns with tamarind seedlings, etc., the French mind, there are pumpkins, sweet and Q-pop, the taste is good. Lemon smoothie with cantaloupe cold soup, and a caramel mango pie, of course, the name is like smoothie, so hot, so hot, the place where the waterfall sweat, only smoothie to relieve worry. Finally, the chef came over to ask for opinions on the taste of the product. He gave a few words and sent a fruit platter. The tropical fruit is still good to eat, although it is very mini.",

The three candidates have the same menu, and they are all satisfied without exception. The front dish: &quot;Shrimp Salad&quot; The fresh shrimp salad is matched with Cambodian-style sauces, and the taste is just right. Another way for too long to remember, only remember the egg silk, fried leaves (tea?) and shrimp patties. The main course: &quot;duck meat&quot; is a bit like oily duck legs, crispy duck silk and sweet and sour fruit, and sprinkle a little lemon juice, the taste is clear. &quot;Frying beef tongue&quot; large beef tongue fried to micro-charred, the entrance is fresh and juicy. Dessert: &quot;Plum dark chocolate Ganna Xu&quot; favorite snow bar with natural sweet and sour fruit.

Our 4 girls ordered 5 dishes, a bowl of powder, and a glass of smoothie per person, and they couldn&#39;t finish it. The sweet and sour red fish is a big one, it is a light sour and sweet taste, unlike the domestic taste, the meat is very tender and there is no small thorn. The fried shrimp is also quite big, but there are only 4, just enough points, the fried time is just right. The portion of the fried fish is also very large, there are two fish willows, and a girl is enough to eat one. Curry is the only curry I have eaten in Angkor, and the curries in other stores are too light to taste. Other dishes are not said one by one. The taste here is more suitable for Chinese people. The taste is very heavy in Angkor. If you go to eat, you really have to go early. It rained on the day we went, but it was full.",

When we went, it was 7:30 in the evening, and it was still in the city. There was no seat at all without booking. This store is opened by the owner in memory of his deceased wife, and there are photos of his wife and some old photos on the wall. The boss is an Australian, personally serving, very humorous, and sometimes comes to chat for a while and have a joke. The restaurant is simplely furnished, but very warm, like at home. The taste of the dish is very in line with us, the most like spicy fried crab, small but thick meat. I also ordered a dessert, mango banyan plus ice cream. The first dinner left us a good impression. Four people ate a total of 43 dollars, not expensive.",

So five days in advance, use email to get a smooth seat! There is no air conditioning, there is an open-air seat, and here is to feel a different Southeast Asian style. The matrix-style three-leaf ceiling fan can not reduce the heat. I found that many menus on the first floor have the original intention of opening a store. Some are the ideals and ambitions of the chef and boss. Like this one, it is because the female owner from Melbourne came to Cambodia to travel and was shocked by the backward educational resources of the locals. Surprised, then left when the English teacher, by chance, opened this store to help employees achieve their dreams with their 10 [%] profit. The waiters here are locals, and she also assists some charities. I think it&#39;s good! fresh coconut Fresh coconut juice: a larger original coconut, frozen is very suitable for the weather with room temperature of more than 30 degrees Celsius. Beef lok lak is one of Cambodia&#39;s national dishes. I must try it here. This one uses Australian beef waist meat, which is very tender, black pepper, garlic, and fragrant with butter sauce. Cucumber slices and tomatoes, lettuce are bottomed, and there are sun eggs embedded in sweet peppers on the side, and there is a pile of rice, one person can eat or share! Khmer curry vegetables, sweet curry sauce, mixed with carrots, peas, onions, old tofu mixed with a vegetable curry, will be accompanied by a bowl of rice, The curry taste is very good into the tofu! Ginger meatballs have ginger in both the soup and the meatballs. The waiter will ask if he is suitable for eating ginger. There are carrot shreds and onions. The soup head has characteristics. I have a hot cold in the air conditioner and sweat under the bowl! Mexican burritos with salsa sauce and sour cream, round tortilla is Mexican special quesadilla, with fried chicken and a lot of cheese, as a staple food is quite rich, sour cream is greasy, chicken is slightly old, a suitable for more than 2 people to share. The most anticipated is cha kadam, a whole crab is cut well, mixed with lemon grass, peppers and other Southeast Asian spices, the taste is very rich, crab meat is also full this season. blue hawaii Blue Hawaii: It is indeed indigo blue, a large cup, the upper layer is ice, the alcohol concentration is relatively high, Black rum, is the best rum in Jamaica, and pineapple juice can improve the fruit aroma and increase acidity, blend blue orange liqueur, etc., the taste is very refreshing, very suitable for girls to drink!",

If you go to no seat, you can ask the boss what delicious shop is nearby. The boss will give a list of restaurants he has eaten that feel good, as well as addresses and phone numbers, especially attentive. The time we went there was a lot of power outage, so the restaurant prepared candles and fans (when the power went out, watermelon juice and apple juice could not be done). The waiter will ask in detail whether the dishes are done together or all done together. You must think well. If you choose all done well, you must endure the pain of serving together at the surrounding tables... The taste of the dishes is very good, loklak&#39;s juice is peppery, although it is sour, it is very good. The tomato pepper outside the egg is very nice. The steak recommends local beef, thick and juicy, which is even better than Australian beef. The steak with mashed potatoes is very delicate and smooth, and the sauce can definitely be a single dish. After the meal desserts - chocolate mousse and pudding are sweet, and sweet a little greasy people, not very suitable and want to eat can order another drink.",

Recommended dishes: fried shrimp, sweet and sour red fish, lak lok, black pepper salmon, fruit shake, spicy fried crab, duck breast salad, amok, lasagna, steamed red fish, mojo, spring rolls, chocolate mousse [/align][align=left] The address is located in the old market, it is said to be the best restaurant in Siem Reap. It is also the best restaurant we have eaten in the past three days. The price is very high. It feels not a complete local restaurant, but it is combined with Western food. The phone given online is right, we went directly to the phone to make an appointment at 19:00. After eating, go directly to the old market to do Massage. I wanted to eat again the next day, but I had a Sunday break. The environment of the restaurant is not very big, not very tall, the most recommended is #black pepper eel#, small, but very fresh, sweet taste, eat and want to eat, only more than 20 rmb a pot, we ate the first pot like order another pot, But you know that everyone basically ordered the recommended dishes in turn and can&#39;t eat them. #Spring rolls#A very common snack here, the dip is very delicious#fried shrimp#The same dip is also very special, the quality of the shrimp is not bad#Chicken Amok with rice#After eating yesterday&#39;s HAVEN, I learned that Cambodia has delicious amok today, so I will be bolder. No disappointment# Italian lasagna# very positive, I have to say that the side dishes, the garlic bread did not disappoint me, the surrounding vegetarian dishes are also very fresh# duck breast salad# this time I feel flat no matter what# beef# this to mention, I mentioned earlier that Cambodia&#39;s cattle are thin like something, I feel very old when I think about it, but before the food was served this time, the waiter actually asked us how familiar it was. I was really moved to cry. . . It turned out that there were still good quality cattle, but we still needed seven points for hygiene. #Sweet and sour red fish#The last network said that the sweet and spicy red fish must be ordered. I think it is also delicious. The fish meat is very sweet and tender. The practice is similar to squirrel salmon, but overall it is not as delicious as said on the Internet. The most amazing is black pepper salmon. The last drink was coconut sand ice and pineapple and mango sand ice. Everyone remembers to eat more mango sand ice in Cambodia. Checkout 51 dollars, and down a person more than 80 yuan, too great value, eat well every day will be in a good mood, see this bill, the mood is better.",

I went very late. It was not dinner or supper, because I felt like my stomach was going to explode, but I still went back to the hotel to eat a light meal. I also booked in advance, the website found the email to write back in seconds, very fast. The area is small and the layout is very good. There is an Italian restaurant like Shanghai Amy, so it feels a bit kind. There will be bread, the free kind. I ordered a pre-vegetable, tuna, the color is very attractive, the pink and tender kind, there are carrots and onions in it, cut into small dices, plus oil and vinegar juice, it is quite healthy, sour and delicious, and the fish is quite delicious. Even if you are not hungry, you can eat a lot of it. Chew sesame vegetables. Very fragrant, why don&#39;t many people like to eat sesame vegetables. The soup is the thick soup made by the original big tomato, a bit sour, there are basil and a little garlic in it, and the bread is excellent, but unfortunately I can&#39;t eat bread, just mean it. I ordered pizza after a tangled bit, but I didn&#39;t want anything topping, just a simple Margarita pizza. Ketchup looks a lot, and Masurira cheese, strong fragrance, thin ground, crispy edges, great dough, the oven should be quite elegant. Friends like to eat Italian rice, is the kind of rice with a slightly raw taste of risotto, there is duck leg rice here, the smoked duck leg is quite chewy, with wild mushrooms, wild is not wild, the taste is still quite balanced, duck meat incense plus mushroom fungus fragrance, The whole meal wanted to contract but the heart was insufficient, but I still couldn&#39;t help but eat several mouthfuls. The taste was very punctual, Amway. happy ending I chose a sweet and sour dessert. The green apple-flavored ice cream ball is inserted with apple crisps, and the following is a thin slice of green apple. I admire the sliced effort, which is as thin as paper. The whole is good, the taste is quite good, I asked for an ice coffee for the drink, in order to refresh, people who only sleep for a few hours a day are completely sleepy. I brushed the visa and remember about 74 knives.",

The result was more than 2 minutes, people were no longer open, so to say that they also provided drinks and coffee, but looked at the tone at all, forget it, and change the direction, we will come back at night, verbal appointment. As a result, we went at night. There were a lot of people, basically full. I chose a set meal for 2 people to share, and then I ordered a cup each. The per capita was like this, but it was also because I had too much food in front of me. I couldn&rsquo;t eat it at all. I ate the same set meal. Very boring, So this approach is the best. It was more than eight o&#39;clock when I went. In fact, there was a garden, and there was a mottled reflection on the wall. There were live geckos on the wall column. I was not afraid. It felt good in the original ecology. I looked at the gecko and found that the small claws of ta were very cute. It was a suction cup. The seat can just see the front desk people and the translucent kitchen, the chef is also a local, almost constantly fighting. Five courses, the speed of serving is average, may also be a relationship with many people. The first road, the signboard, three Gogong scallops, the big scallops are seasoned very fresh and delicious, opening the taste buds, it is used in turmeric powder and sesame oil, no wonder, there are seaweed plus salad oil and coconut meat, some black pepper made a good taste, I was surprised at the first level. The second road, jungle sour soup, there are red ant powder in it, but the dark environment is not carefully seen, the fish is catfish, that is, the carp, Southeast Asia&#39;s practice is still unique, adding mangosteen leaves, water lily flower stems and lotus root knots, fish meat is quite bullet teeth, The taste is not mutual but a light original taste, not bad. The third course is prawns, pickled brahok, shredded pork and eggplant matched with coconut juice and tamarind, etc. The taste is quite special, the prawns are particularly delicious, just one person. The fourth is the clear oxtail, with espresso, which is a small creative one. It is also dotted with onions and radishes. The oxtail parts can be handled and it is very rotten. The fifth is the dessert that ends, as end or end of the delicious, is a hot lava chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream, really ice and fire twice, plus handmade mango jam, eating very happy. The name of the store was last seen as a simple coffee shop. It turned out to be deep and the wine was delicious. However, it is a bit unsatisfactory compared to the service, it is not bad, it is very embarrassing~",

The first dish is the store&#39;s special local Gogong scallops, three, scallops with turmeric powder and sesame oil after development, the selection of seaweed, salad, and the best part of coconut meat as ingredients in the scallop, plus pepper fragments, sour and sweet and refreshing appetizer. The second dish is the jungle series of sour soup, the carp fillet in the soup is pickled by red ant powder, and then the wild mangosteen leaves, lotus root and water lotus stems are matched, the taste is light, highlighting the taste of the original ingredients, the fish is chewy. The third dish is brahok, a selection of prawns, with tamarind, coconut juice, chopped pork and eggplant under it, rich in taste, rich in sweetness. The fourth dish is more interesting, the combination of clear oxtail and espresso coffee is very creative, the radish onion and flower stems are embellished, and the oxtail is very tasty. Last dessert hot lava chocolate, handmade mango sauce with passion fruit, with a vanilla ice cream. Hot and cold, stimulate taste buds. Such a set of gourmet menu 24 US dollars, no service fee, taste experience is quite value, a small amount, light food, everything is just right. The only dissatisfaction is the service, hope to improve.",

The layout of orange yarn is full of romantic atmosphere. Cambodian spring rolls, meat chopped and cucumber, Lettuce and other fillings are wrapped in a thin transparent spring roll skin like flapping wings. The entrance is soft and juicy, and the taste buds are completely opened because of this dish. Tonyingong soup, shrimp meat and salmon meat freshly bounced teeth, Tonyingong soup is fragrant and not snoring, and the aroma of citrus is rolled into your nasal cavity from time to time. It is also a delicious dish that makes people eat a lot! Cambodian fried cabbage is full of flavor and flavor, and I will eat the CD in a short time. Drinks and fruits are also real ingredients to drink and eat. In general, Chef D&#39; Angkor Restaurant is indeed a restaurant that I have to eat in Siem Reap.",

Dozens of varieties have oysters, well-known and cooked. The locals often eat a hot pot restaurant. The self-service form is waiting for the soup to open. My sweat has flowed into a waterfall. Fortunately, I sprayed perfume in DFS! The local popular self-service hot pot is open at 5:30, but it is almost good to arrive an hour and a half early! 5 dollars to eat but not include drinks. I saw the drink a la carte and soy milk, which is still domestic. Before the meal, the stove will be heated by heating hot pot. Their structure is a bit different from the domestic hot pot. The hollow grid can heat meat, chicken, pork, beef, etc. It is best to apply some butter to avoid sticking to the pot but there is no here. The side can be added with clear soup, so every time you pick things will not be too much. A row of vegetarian combinations of vegetarians, cold raw ones can be matched. There are not many varieties of seasonings, almost all with some spicy. Fried noodles are recommended, and the taste is generally good. There are also spring rolls that will not be particularly greasy. The seafood in the base shrimp is fresh and not bad. In short, if you eat a wall and a high hot pot under a limited budget, you can walk up.",

        "comment": "Siem Reap must experience|On the last afternoon of the net red swing afternoon tea Siem Reap, free time to drink the swing afternoon tea in the hotel. The environment is a highlight, and the swing sofa seat is very girlish. Although it is outdoors, it is well ventilated and will not feel hot. Swing seats can seat 4 people, sitting rickety on it makes people feel very enjoyable. The outdoor swing seats are on the first floor, less than 10 seats, there are vacancies without appointments, probably related to non-peak seasons. The indoor location is also great, the black color is very textured, the room is air-conditioned, and you can sit here if you are afraid of heat. The design style of the first floor and the second floor is different. The second floor is like a living room. It is very suitable for friends to gather. The food was just after lunch, and only snack platters and drinks were ordered. The snack platter is about two people&#39;s weight, but the amount is also small and the taste is ordinary. There are rice rolls, chicken wings, skewers. Ice American, mango milkshake taste is acceptable. In short, it is a place to eat the environment. If you just want to feel it, you can also just order a drink and feel the atmosphere here.",

Sitting on the bed with friends or confidants, a cup of mellow coffee, a fun book, a leisurely time. The consumption of Kroya restaurant is not low, and a 20% service fee and tax are required. However, the restaurant is elegantly furnished and comfortable, and occasionally luxurious. The restaurant focuses on Khmer Western food, freshly squeezed carrot juice and apple juice are sweet and fresh, and the heat will be completely eliminated in one bite. Curry soft shell crab curry has a strong aroma, spicy just right, and bibimbap with curry sauce is even more perfect! After the meal, there is no shortage of desserts, bananas seem to be the home of Siem Reap desserts. Chop the bananas thickly and then wrap them in pancake skins, pour them with chocolate sauce and cream mousse, and sweeten them to the heart. The almond cake is too soft with snowballs, the almond outer skin is crispy and fragrant, and the inside is soft and sweet.",

If it is not too hot, you will definitely choose to hammock. The first feeling of the indoor environment is that the air-conditioning is too sufficient. Many people say that when they come to Cambodia, the air-conditioning is a must. I don&rsquo;t know how many people have turned to other homes because the restaurant has air-conditioning. In addition, the restaurant environment affiliated to the high-end hotel is also tall enough. It is a great place to eat here.

The grilled ribs are also not bad, one has 5 ribs, and the roast is fragrant and delicious. The chicken is a bit greasy, and the filling is wrapped in the leaves of the chicken and pork. Garlic hollow cabbage is like a week in the refrigerator and fried, not fresh at all. Jasmine tea is served in the whole pot, and the teapot is beautiful.",

Their restaurant was fully booked for the next few nights and suggested we book dinner in advance. The meat is slow to cook. I don&#39;t know how they do it, but the curry is thick and refreshing like cream. I&#39;d love to know how they do it. I think we&#39;ll order some vegetables next time. My wife didn&#39;t like to order hot drinks like I did, so I ordered her at medium temperature and the waiter took out a green chili for us to try. We would come back again.",

In addition to Indian dishes, Indian dishes, Khmer dishes, even Chinese food, people have multiple choices, curry must try, pancakes are also available, pancakes are fragrant and crispy, the taste depends on the individual, but they are all curry juice to eat.

Indian restaurant with indie song and dance, closed eyes on the sofa with tape, I can cross to the Taj Mahal or the Ganges River, the boss looks like an Indian! #Ctrip Food Forest# Lemon Tea There is a need for hot and cold. If the weather is hot, I will choose iced lemon tea. There are fresh lemon slices inside, sour and sweet and appetizing. Masala chai, Indian tea, special drinks, after adding three tablespoons of sugar, the taste is reflected, there is a strong masala spice flavor. Generally speaking, it will be warmer in winter when drinking tea. plain yoghurt, the sweet yogurt is very thick, especially sour and a little honey tastes much better. garlic bread, like a pizza, thin bottom, covered with garlic, the fragrance will exude when the table is served, a crispy bite, highly recommended. chicken tikka masala, tikka is bbq, chicken is very tasty, and it is better to add some rice to mix. The same vegetables are also masala, the mixed vegetable juice is very thick, and the bibimbap is first-class. Roti is a thin bottom stew, slightly burnt, original Indian pancakes, generally they will eat all day, with Indian curry is simply a perfect match.",

It arrives at around noon and there is a table inside, but there are 8 Indians behind, and they come later than me but come first! The serving speed is very slow, it can be seen that the chef is very careful to cook, and the order is a bit too much. The fried rice ordered by the baby is a bit weird, but fortunately, I am more used to eating, and the masters don&#39;t like it; Highly recommend curry (triangular type), hot to eat, crispy outer skin, rich filling, strong curry flavor, pork onions and other kinds, delicious! Garlic scones, garlic freshly baked crisp cakes, with curry sauce, delicious! Red is chicken nuggets, but the taste is not sweet and sour in Malaysia, generally! Curry beef, beef tastes, not old, the bibimbap sauce is really good! Finally pay 35 knives!",

After a long time of curiosity, it was finally empty. The low-key &quot;Little Red Fox&quot; Little Red Fox Coffee Shop is hidden on a small street in the city center, and the surrounding area is very quiet and a bit difficult to find. At the main entrance of the store, there are many potted plants with large leaves (I mistakenly thought it was a flower shop at first), and the tables and chairs are the kind of very literary red with a sense of age. On the wall where the door was entered, there were books for the shopkeepers to read, and then the aisle, on the other side of the wall, there were three tables, and there were several pastoral oil paintings on the aisle wall. Take the stairs to the second floor, continue to walk to the innermost cabin, the light is getting dimmer, a glass coffee table is placed in the middle of the cabin, three sofas and two lazy chairs are placed around the coffee table, a yellow light lamp, I suddenly felt that the cabin was suitable for my otagonist&#39;s environment. I sat on a lazy chair with my ass, followed the waiter behind to see me seated, immediately smiled, asked me what to drink, and a cup of the store&#39;s special unsweetened latte. Taste food I think, the reason for this store fire is mainly that the decoration style can hook people&#39;s petty bourgeoisie and their boss&#39;s public welfare; of course, the food in the store is enough to attract people, the most popular in the store is latte and apple yogurt. The dense milk bubble is very good to blend the bitter taste of espresso, it is worthy of a strong latte. For ladies, I recommend apple yogurt. The yogurt here is made by the boss himself. I heard from friends who often come. The apple sour grandmother is rich in fragrance and has a weight loss beauty effect. \u203b Warm reminder business hours: 6:00&mdash;24:00 Recommended food: Latte coffee, coconut coffee, apple yogurt, cheese berries, fruit salad, red wine",

I am not very sure about the bad reviews here, because I personally think it is great. There are not many types of breakfast menu here, but all we ordered are very good. Ice latte is the best way to start the day. Lunch is also great. If you don&#39;t want to eat Khmer dishes that are available in the city, a la carte and salad are also great here. Dinner is always excellent, the wine list is great, and there are delicious cocktails. My kids were happy with the kids menu and the waiters were always near to meet any of our needs. I would come back here anytime, even though I stayed at another hotel. The experience here was very romantic, special, really beautiful",

        "comment": "If you are a vegetarian or want to change your taste when traveling in Siem Reap, then you are highly recommended to visit the restaurant Banlle vegetarian, which is mainly organic and natural, and fruits and vegetables are grown on your own farm or shipped to the store by nearby organic farms. In the hot afternoon, Siem Reap sat in the lush yard and ate. Occasionally a breeze blew, and the heart also felt happy. Drink a cup of freshly squeezed juice and the heat was all gone. The owner who pays great attention to environmental protection, the straws are made of stainless steel. The appetizer is a &quot;salad&quot; made with banana flowers combined with tomatoes, which is more like soup, and the banana flowers taste fresh and open the taste buds quickly. Quesadilla is actually a frying pan with cheese and meat, spread on a large tortilla, and folded in half. At first glance, I thought the taste would be as greasy as Pizza. I never thought of the combination of tomatoes, cheese and avocado. The entrance not only does not feel greasy, but also makes people eat more and more appetizing. The dessert after the meal is very Chinese-style simi lu and snowball feeling, surprising is that the sweetness is just right, the coconut meat is fresh and juicy, and I eat the CD without knowing it.",

It is worth mentioning that the walls of the temple are still preserved with rich and vivid sculptures, and all the ancient war accounts, the life of ordinary people, and the scenery of the lakeside of Donglisa Lake fully reveal the scene at that time, which is definitely a precious historical monument that must be seen.

In addition to coffee drinks, all kinds of burgers, salads, desserts and other light foods can be eaten. Although the price is small, it is still a cloud for diners.

The round pot below cooks the vegetable hot pot. It actually feels like eating it, and the price is not cheap, and the portion is not large. It is just enough for one person to eat after ordering two people. The meat is probably fish, chicken, pig, cattle, sheep, bullfrog, crocodile, etc., according to the price portion, different. The bullfrog meat was too fishy by them, the crocodile meat was too salty, and there was no traditional barbecue fragrance. At most, the meat was hot on the top with the temperature of the pot. The hot pot below was simply boiled vegetable noodles in water. The three dishes of marinade tasted strange and did not meet the appetite of the Chinese. But it&#39;s too light. In short, if you want to enjoy food or fill your stomach, it is not recommended. By the way, his family can renew the noodles for free except for meat!",

It is BBQ, but I think it is more like a combination of barbecue and hot pot. Spread out the various pieces of meat evenly over the raised area in the middle of the pan and roast until golden on both sides, while the soup around the pan is used to stew various vegetables and noodles. The fat of the barbecue above the top flows into the soup, which not only solves the greasy barbecue above the top, but also makes the vegetables cooked below not too light. BBQ meat has more than 10 kinds of chicken, fish, beef, pork, bullfrog meat, crocodile meat, etc. In order to let customers understand what these are, each meat is specially inserted on a small label with the corresponding animal pattern. Among them, crocodile meat may be our domestic rarely contact, but to be honest, this crocodile meat is really not delicious, I don&#39;t know if it is a problem with the stain, or we roast too much, in short, this crocodile meat is salty and woody in the mouth, and can&#39;t chew. BBQ marinade is not very suitable for my taste. Besides meat, BBQ vegetables, rice and noodles are free and unlimited. As for how this BBQ taste, I can only say that its fun should be more interesting than the taste of the dish itself, if you are holding the purpose of tasting the feast, treasure the delicious, then I advise you to save it!",

Because this is a very easy and unforgettable shop in Pub Street. It is decorated in an English industrial style, with beautiful lighting on the bar table and a series of foreign wines neatly arranged. Pizza is baked in the oven, and you can enjoy a special cocktail of 1.5 USD all day, and there are many flavor options. 4.5 The dollar Dim sum is improved, making rich fillings into cute little blessing bags and then frying, with Japanese sauces to collide with novel sparks. 5.5 The dollar Caesar salad is enough for3-4 people to eat together, but the taste is not very good. 4.75 US dollar roast chicken wings, correctly speaking, are roasted full wings, because they are cut and roasted with a knife, so they are particularly delicious. It is said that eating desserts will get better, and a caramel pudding is specially made after dinner. In general, the taste and mood are good, and the price is small.",

Until now, I still miss its European industrial environment and the special cocktails that its family can drink for US$ 1. Although the price of cocktails is very cheap, there are still a variety of flavors to choose from, and it is especially beautiful to drink different flavors every day! The bar counter is beautifully lit and neatly placed with a series of foreign wines. In addition to cocktails, staple foods and snacks are also very pleasant. For example, make Dim sum into a blessing bag and then fry it, such as roasting all wings, because it is grilled with a knife, so it is particularly tasty.",

I also called a tutu back to the hotel, but the process was really not as simple as I imagined. In a boutique hotel, it&rsquo;s just across the pool. The environment is OK, but because I went late, I was a guest. I was quite scared. I asked how long it would take to prepare the meal I wanted, because my camera charger and spare battery fell in front of the front of the meal. In the hall, I was afraid that people would get off work, and then I would not open the door the next day, so I would be blind. Then the waiter said that 10mins helped me prepare, I have been holding my mobile phone to see the time, of course, the last is cheating me, 1 hour is almost the same, I poured the kitchen door to the door many times, and I greeted the chef, but unfortunately their slow movements are probably used to it, or methodical what to do, Fortunately, in the end, although I was half an hour late, I seriously praised the restaurant in front of me - georges, the waiter and the chef were waiting for me, moved. Back to the truth, ordering, their menu also lay a corpse of an insect, did not dare to look carefully, the waiter is also calm. I ordered a few dishes probably because it was too late. So simple and simple. A cup of iced coffee, just drink it, this seems to be made by the waiter himself, the taste is OK, no sugar water, slightly bitter. Chicken spring rolls, look not amazing, look very ordinary, it can be said that there is no snack bar at my door to sell well, but the taste is really good, there is a sentence. It is not greasy to eat, and the ingredients inside are quite fragrant, but I generally like to eat more three silk spring rolls. Prawn salad, shrimp shell ring placed in high-legged glass, below is vegetable salad, etc., looks OK, the taste is light. Come to Siem Reap must order amoc, taste everywhere, there is the taste of turmeric, lemon leaves, fish meat, but also very elegant in the banana leaves, you can have, the rice is better, the spice taste is quite strong. I was really impatient. Several desserts were packaged directly back to the hotel. As a result, their packing speed and effect made me very dissatisfied. I couldn&#39;t take pictures at all, so I didn&#39;t eat it and was dizzy.",

        "comment": "Fine French food has always been widely loved, and diners who are keen on French food can be very lucky to find many chic French restaurants with independent courtyards in Siem Reap, most of which require advance reservations. l annexe is located near the most lively bar street in Siem Reap. It is attracted by this exquisite door before entering the door. The garden is well maintained. The waiters are very warm to entertain us and introduce special meals one by one. The chef is French, came to Siem Reap five years ago, opened this l annexe three years ago, to create a high-end French meal. All the meals are from Australia, France, New Zealand, not Siem Reap ingredients, in order to ensure quality, attracted many Chinese Hong Kong and Japanese diners to go. Each dish is very beautiful, the restaurant presents three snacks, shrimp tapas, pre-dinner bread and vegetable soup made of broccoli, cauliflower, onion, it looks very small bowl, in fact, it takes a lot of effort and time. After the front dish choose the restaurant&#39;s most popular avocado salad, the sheep milk cheese, tomato and avocado mixed, can be paired with garlic garlic bread diy into papes, adding fun, shrimp meat and grilled tomatoes composed of seafood skewers, placed on the avocado tower, Finally, with crisps as embellishment, the beautiful raw tomatoes spread around, did not use too much seasoning, as much as possible to retain the original taste of the food. The side dishes of lamb chops are also very recommended. The slow cooking of French potatoes for a long time adds flavor. Even the broccoli on the side is also specially smoked. It is fried with butter. If you like heavy taste, there is also a small pot of sauce that can be poured on the meat. The menu is duck legs, the hidden menu is duck breast meat, the duck breast meat is very crisp, the duck meat is full and tender, there is no flavor, the sauce is made into coffee pull-like, the ingredients are the same as the lamb chops. French desserts are famous, l annexe desserts are basically in 5-6.5 dollars, the price is very close to the people. Choose two desserts, the first special black pearl black pearl, is a round shell of chocolate, hidden in strawberry ice cream, beautiful appearance hidden under the amazing and cool taste; Another dessert is chocolate pie, bottomed with French biscuits, icing made of Fifa chocolate, very thick, ice cream with bourbon vanilla sauce, making the taste more layered. This meal costs $65 locally, and I am very satisfied with Amway.",

Looking at the current magic capital, the 40-degree high temperature has not come down. At that time, I have already sweated. And the first floor of his house is all natural wind, and the second floor has air conditioning, but I am also lazy to go upstairs. Look at the faces of the waiters are very young, not child labor. After turning over, the introduction is related to charity, and it will help some homeless children and marginal teenagers, etc., which is also very good. There will be free lemonade, I will have a smoothie, thick berry topping, and a little acid. I ordered the famous red ant beef, which is a must-point signboard. My friends closed their eyes. After I took a good photo, I ate a few red ants and beef. The main reason was sweet and sour. I couldn&#39;t eat a special taste. There were some nuts on the side, so it was better to stir it. The color of the soup is very Western, pumpkin and spinach, like this orange red and green will feel that this will not match, but the taste is not bad, there are some black beans inside, quite dense sweet taste, more natural. Slow pork ribs with radish salad, it is an entree, it is also one of the must-order signs, rib displacement can be, count a few 6 large pieces, the taste is very rich because the sauce on the top is very strong, with the salad to clear some. Spring rolls, eat a feeling that you can compete with one, the taste is really good, is the taro taste, fried transparent, so the epidermis is soft inside, with citrus ginger sauce, sour and sweet, taro taste is also can not cover. Xianglan Mango glutinous rice, Southeast Asian characteristics, mango selection is very good, each piece is very sweet, several ingredients are always delicious together, and the color is still so out of the selection. After that, I also sent some fruit, there is red hair Dan, it is very good, eat and chat and make a pot of tea, the small environment can be, the price is also ok.",

        "comment": "Marum is a very famous restaurant, and after mentioning it with the car rental driver, he immediately opened his own navigation. The feature is to combine with public welfare to help street children and young people on the edge. The restaurant waiter greeted at the door, the same garden restaurant, with open-air view and indoor dining options. There is no air conditioning on the first floor, and the paintings on the wall are the works of those street children, red chairs and green walls, full of love. What is not to be missed is the red ant beef. The red ant is really used. After the table, it is a bit creepy. The ants are completely presented next to the beef, but after mixing, they will not panic. After a taste, the meat is chewy, slightly spicy, and the ants are basically integrated into the meat. It hardly feels the taste, the seasoning is a little more, the strong sauce flavor. Plus peanuts and nuts, it is indeed a local feature. The second recommended specialty is slow-simmered pork ribs with apple radish salad, six large pork ribs are placed neatly, the meat is very tender and easy to cut, the taste is slightly local vanilla, and the salad has a musk fragrance. A pumpkin soup with spinach and black beans is a relatively novel ingredients, sweet and not bad. Taro spring rolls are more special, the outer and inner heat, pick up citrus ginger sauce, bite down and smell the aroma of taro. Citrus mango glutinous rice, beautiful color, mango cut just right, sweetness is right, the citrus juice drip on glutinous rice and enjoy, a mouth can taste the sweet taste of citrus, I have to say that in the selection of ingredients, marum is a little different, a little interesting. I ordered a pot of marum homemade tea, there is no taste, chatting with friends for a long time, and it just happens to avoid the hot afternoon in the summer. Finally, although the red ant beef is not finished, it is still worth recommending. Remember to make an appointment in the evening market.",

But there are many mosquitoes without air conditioning, which affects the viewing. There is no hope for food, but there are also recommended things. fired noodle+bbq, I ate two copies, and finally came back to fruit.

I thought Angkor would not have delicious Chinese food, but I found that there are still restaurants that can cook Chinese food, and the environment is first-class. The restaurant is simply in stark contrast to the broken road outside, and there is a small fountain made of rockery... The environment is antique, I ordered two dishes, Two people, a red curry chicken, a roasted chicken leg, and two bottles of Coke, because I asked if rice was included in it, there was no other, and there was no low consumption! The most surprising meal is still free to add, is brown rice, I personally like to eat brown rice, chewy. There is also a head plate, which is a small spring roll... Don&#39;t look at the pot small, eat very full, we added a meal. The waiter is very patient and the service is very thoughtful. This is a tipping country. If you feel good service, you can give a tip to the waiter, because the bill does not include service fees, but only taxes. The overall taste is also suitable for Chinese people, that is, the citrus taste is a little stronger.",

I like it very much. The strong Cambodian flavor is highlighted, sour, sweet and spicy. But older people don&#39;t seem to be very comfortable with this taste. This Dongyin soup tastes sweet, without Thai acid, which is also good. Curry is also a little sweet. But the last fruit dessert does not feel sweet, this fruit is always not as sweet as I thought, I guess the hope is too high. Generally speaking, it is a very authentic Cambodian restaurant, but it depends on personal taste.

The waiter has Chinese, there is also a Chinese menu, ordering is quite convenient, but the service is very general. Ordered mango glutinous rice, pineapple rice, seafood fried pho, spring rolls, dragon fruit smoothie. The smoothie tastes very strong and the dragon fruit is very sweet.

Beef noodles are especially recommended, the color and fragrance are complete, the beef portion is particularly sufficient, the meat is large and tender, the fat meat is just right, you can not eat such an affordable beef noodles in China, the noodles are only a little bit, the soup is not much, the real beef is all beef, it is said that the beef soup is not too much!

But seeing locals pack twice as much food as I want, including soup and meat, is only $2. Cambodia&#39;s average monthly income is less than $200, the food should have been super cheap, and it should be calculated that the price of more than half of the Chinese restaurant is reasonable. But curiously, you can try it at different restaurants every day. The Japanese buffet on the second floor of the Lucky Mall next door is $4 from Monday to Friday. Many cafeterias are $5, $6, $7, etc. The travel agency with the performance is very good for 8 dollars.

The restaurant is large in size, and there are many tour groups, which are very lively. There are more varieties of dishes that taste good. Tonyin Gong is delicious, plus some noodles and some curry juice is great. Beer needs to be paid separately, and small windows can be fried vegetables.",

This buffet is not bad for group meals, there are basically some~ The buffet should not expect any super service, at least the replenishment will wake up in time! The fruit is very fresh.",

The restaurant is very large, typical Angkor decoration style, and there is a large stage. The buffet table is on the left side of the entrance and the dining area is on the right side of the entrance. To be honest, there are quite a lot of varieties, but they are all more ordinary dishes, taste, and quite satisfactory. The biggest feature is that there is a performance when eating, but it is too noisy, and because there are many tour groups, the order is not very good, affecting the appetite.",

We came at 12 dollars a person at night, it seems that there is a discount to buy online in advance. The dishes are okay, fried fried and boiled, etc. are a lot, worthy of the restaurant price. It is worth noting that you should come early. The restaurant wrote that it was snoring at 9 o&#39;clock. We ended the performance in a few minutes at 8 o&#39;clock. Then there were not many people in the restaurant, which caused us to eat a little anxious. When 8:30, the restaurant was almost no one.",

There are not many people in the store during the day. Because there is a show at night, I will not go upstairs during the day. I can only choose the sofa chair in the store downstairs. There is no air conditioning and only ceiling fans, but sitting calmly will not feel hot. I ordered iced coffee \u2615\ufe0f2.75 USD, small size. The price is moderate, the view is very good, watching the bustling crowd on the road, feeling the Cambodian style \uff5e\uff5e",

When I was looking for a companion, he was worried about a girl comforting, providing a mobile phone, and finding someone for me. So I went to his Chinese restaurant at night. For the rib control, I saw garlic ribs and boiled beef. I couldn&#39;t refuse. The taste could be 70 points. It was a bit dry to eat local beef in Cambodia and the taste was not good. The Chinese will also make beef, the meat is tender. It is worth mentioning that the owner of this store does not do tour group meals, because he wants to ensure the taste and quality of the ingredients, and the cheap dishes cannot produce good works. Give a compliment to the boss for sticking to the good principle! The taste is very good.",

There are dining areas on the first and second floors, with wooden spiral stairs to pick up the stairs, and the faint Indian style is integrated during the period. First-class transparent kitchen can see the busy Indian chef, see the diners are dark skin-based Indians and European and American people, see the ranking is in the forefront of Indian cuisine, it is still very wise to eat off the peak, generally have to wait, there are also outdoor seats. The second Indian dish, this time I ordered the store signboard! veg samosa, Indian triangle bag, curry-flavored fried dumplings, rich fillings, potato mixed fennel, beans, etc., a bit spicy, it is a very popular Indian snack! Tandoori chicken,. The leg meat is oversized, marinated and roasted after seasoning with yogurt and spices, the skin is red and colorful, it is medium to heavy spicy, squeeze some lemon to eat a bite is very tender but the taste is also very special, belonging to the North Indian court dish series. prwan curry, Indians use spices, especially curry, curry milk is rich, super like to eat with rice. Aloo mutter, green bean potato meat, curry sauce is very thick, very suitable for rice or stew, more vegetarian. coconut rice With curry, the rice has a faint coconut fragrance, and some sesame seeds are dried! Mango kulfi, cut into cheese shape Indian handmade ice cream, fruit flavor in addition to mango and lychee, more traditional is malai pista, will add happy and almond, milk flavor, and Western ice cream is still different.",

The cooking process is very interesting XD chaf is a very interesting person, keep arranging us you do this, you do that, and teach us to carve radish flowers hahaha~ In short, it is very recommended~~",

        "comment": "Some restaurants are countless people telling you that it is not delicious, and then you will still go to punch a card. . Siem Reap Khmer Kitchen is this kind of existence. It is almost a must-check restaurant for Chinese people to travel to Siem Reap. Not far from Siem Reap Bar Street and the old market, in the hot Siem Reap, calling a taxi should be the most convenient transportation method. If it is near the old market, it will generally not exceed a quarter of an hour on foot. Since the signature dishes in the Khmer kitchen are definitely a point, you will find that many people have 7 or 8 points of dishes on the table. &quot;amoc fish&quot; Cambodian national dish, the same practice also has amoc chicken, amoc cattle and so on. Mainly amoc powder and coconut milk for seasoning, it should be the best in the whole venue. &quot;Khmer Curry Beef&quot; The curry beef here is a Khmer dish. The beef is a bit old, but it seems that the beef and pigs here are old. &quot;Dongyin Gong Soup&quot; still loves Thailand&#39;s Dongyin Gong Soup. It is not sour or spicy enough, and the citrus taste is lighter. &quot;Vietnam Spring Rolls&quot; Spring Rolls are very full, and it is a bit greasy to eat behind. &quot;Cashew Shake&quot; Unlocks the new skill of cashew milkshake. The taste is a bit small and special, but it is not bad to drink. If you like nut milkshake, you can try it. Because Khmer Kitchen is a popular restaurant for travel, the travel season needs to be booked on the official website or through the chartered driver in advance, otherwise you may not be able to eat.",

The location is also very good, very easy to find, the environment is also very cool! The waiter&#39;s attitude is very, very good! This is a compliment! ! ! The most interesting thing is that after eating, a staff member took a sign (guide the bathroom or something), which had Chinese on it, and then he asked me to help see if it came out, so everyone went to the Khmer kitchen in the future. If you find that there is a mistake in Chinese instructions, Welcome to find me more interesting things \uff5e Welcome everyone to pay attention to the official account: Crazy female ranger takes you to the world \uff5e",

The taste of Khmer cuisine is more in line with the taste of the Chinese, especially the fried fish here, the outer and inner tender. The taste of spring rolls is very local, with a variety of vegetables breaded, and you will feel very refreshing when you bite. Curry beef is the first choice for people who love curry, the curry is extremely rich, and the beef tastes very moderate. Finally, call a big coconut, pour ice cubes inside, and drink a sip is heaven on earth.",

It naturally attracts many European and American guests. The ice cream here is more famous. There are disk-shaped combinations, and there is also a simple type of ball. The price is really too affordable. In order to try several flavors, Xia Mo ordered a banana boat and three single balls. The waiter sister shook her head and said to me: too much \uff5e haha, I know it too. The banana boat is so big that it is equivalent to a three-color ice cream with Luxury before, and it is also strawberry, vanilla and chocolate. The four flavors of the single ball are very good, but there are cookies in stracciatella, which is more fragrant; Strawberry, passion fruit taste like Xueba, sour and sweet, especially refreshing; the pistachio taste is my first time to try, I feel that there is no imaginary fruit aroma.",

My mother ordered a fried seafood 4.75 knife. The taste is sweet. The shrimp is small. The freshness is generally the same, and it doesn&#39;t feel like it is made with very fresh shrimp. We felt like we ate the taste in Guangdong. Because we didn&#39;t eat enough, we ordered a green pepper fried salmon 5.5 knife, the weight is small, I feel that there is only that small salmon, I feel and that there are a few. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because only me and my mother are eating, so the weight is less! The two have a total of 13 knives. Low cost performance!

At the beginning, we didn&#39;t know this store, it was recommended by the boss of Genevieve&#39;&#39;s restaurant (because the first time I went to his house without reservation, there was no seat, I asked the boss if he recommended the restaurant, he recommended three, this is one of them), and then took the To To car to the restaurant. The restaurant is operated by a couple, the male is European, the female is Cambodian locals, the two have a very cute child. The hostess is generally responsible for cooking, the male host is responsible for takeaway errands, etc. His dishes are not very expensive, but the taste is very good, the egg roll with spicy sauce is delicious and appetizing, the taste of the loklak sauce is lighter than other restaurants, but it still makes people have a great appetite. The hostess personally used the pancake that the classmates ate, and let the classmates recall the feeling of the first pancake. When there are not many people, the boss and the proprietress will chat with you and ask if you have any suggestions for eating. The most amazing thing is that the boss didn&#39;t even know the boss of Genevieve&#39;&#39;s restaurant, and he told us that he was curious about the speed of the increase in guests, and they all said that it was recommended by the boss to eat at their store.",

If you don&#39;t like the strange taste, it is not recommended. It happened that while I was waiting for the meal, the kitchen grocery shopping person came back, and I had several vegetarian dishes and beef. The dishes and beef were fresh and the service was very good. There was a big brother who could speak English and a little Chinese. He might work in the restaurant and work part-time as a tutu driver. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great price.",

I ordered beef scrambled egg noodles. I found that Cambodia&#39;s fried rice fried noodles are simply sweet and not sour. And sweet is very appetizing, so hot, so sweet, it can trigger people&#39;s appetite, and amok chicken. I think amok is a lemon-flavored curry. Sour and sweet with a spicy bibimbap is perfect. The chicken is a bit old, this rice is a bit hard and the taste is clear. Still OK.",

Curry chicken rice. Two dogs&#39; beef rice sauce, the amount is good, full of stars recommended! After lunch, the next stop is the first local dessert shop in Siem Reap. BLOOM CAFE is open from 10 am to 5 pm, with the most delicious cupcakes in the local area. I ordered two cupcakes of sea salt caramel and red velvet, plus iced coffee and juice, a total of 7 knives, which is touching enough. Bloom cafe&#39;s desserts are mainly cupcakes, the taste is sweet, if we like desserts like we must not miss the dessert, as usual, go to the old market for dinner and drink fruit smoothie. I bought 3 knives and 1 knives and 1 knives and 1 knives and 1 knives and 1 knives and 1 knives and 1 bag of large mangoes. 5555... I haven&#39;t eaten durian in the south of China.

On the second floor, there is a live band singing, there are popular English songs on the list of the population, and there are also Cambodian songs. The atmosphere of the whole bar is quite good, not noisy or deserted, and the waiter&#39;s service is quite satisfactory. The price of beer is OK, the price of cocktails and other bartenders will be more expensive. When I came, it was basically full, and I finally found a vacant seat.",

It was also very interesting to sit on the sofa on the balcony and watch people come and go. The price is not cheap, drinking local beer will be slightly cheaper, cocktails or something is still a bit expensive. Very suitable for friends to come together. The whole Temple bar has three floors, the first floor is a ballroom, and the third floor is a quieter lounge.",

        "comment": "#Monthly special plan \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f The itinerary for Cambodia was finalized in mid-March. It is a country that I want to see very early. I am still worried about the children&#39;s adaptation to the environment along the way, but the result is unexpectedly good. \u2708\ufe0f Departure from Beijing, transfer to Guangzhou for 2h, luggage is directly hung up. The start of the trip was still very smooth, and the flight was told that the flight was delayed and the time was to be determined. This is simply bad news for the transit flight, and I have been struggling with whether the second flight is cancelled. Waiting while waiting, I can finally board the plane. When I arrived in Guangzhou, I took off the plane after the customs. I didn&#39;t delay at all. I landed in Siem Reap, and I was thrilled and thrilled. \u2460 Siem Reap Airport: getting off the plane was a heat wave, there was a lot of soil on the road, but the greening of the airport was good. \u2461 Customs and tip: After 10 minutes at customs, there is no situation where tip is asked. If you encounter a refusal, you must be righteous. \u2462 Security issues: Siem Reap is a tourist city where Angkor Wat is a tourist city from all over the world. The tourist area is still relatively safe and there is no problem with free travel. Don&#39;t worry about taking the baby, the locals are very nice. \u2463 Visa: You can apply for an electronic sign in advance, or you can sign on the ground. \u2464 Transportation: The city is basically a sudden car, cash payment. Take the bus from Siem Reap to Battambang, you can choose Larryta or other companies, watch the time shift on 12go, and then go to the corresponding official website to buy. \u2465 Accommodation and meals: Siem Reap&#39;s Bar Street or near the old market, eating is very convenient, dispelling the concerns of dirty and messy water and soil, famous red piano bar, Khmer kitchen, white roses in Battambang, that noodle restaurant, etc. \u2466 Essential items: sunscreen, mosquito repellent water. \u2467 Tickets: Go to the ticket purchase hall, there will be a photo on-site when you buy the ticket, remember to smile. \u26a0\ufe0f tips: &radic; It is best to find a good communication in Chinese for the sudden car. It is very low to find the price that morning. &radic; Prepare a small dollar, mostly pay in US dollars, less than 1 US dollars in local currency Reel. &radic; Keep a good look at the introduction of the attractions in advance, do a good job in the guide, you can save the cost of asking the tour guide to explain, and the on-site tour guide is also available. &radic; It is not recommended to rent a motorcycle or bicycle. &radic; It takes more time to take a long-distance bus, and it is not necessarily time to leave the bus on time. \ud83d\udc49 Tired of seeing people in the crowd, if you want to see different, just come with us~ Looking forward to your attention! #Winter Roaming Guide",

There is plenty of space in this renovated, elegant colonial building to relax. It is located on the corner of Bar Street and is in a great location. It is a typical French building with two floors and a condescending balcony overlooking the lively Bar Street street. The biggest highlight is on the second floor, a striking red piano, which is probably the origin of the restaurant&#39;s name, and all visitors here will take a photo with the &quot;red piano&quot;.",

Only more than 100 meters away, it is said that there were sporadic coffee shops more than a decade ago, which are just quiet streets where foreigners come by when they buy things from the old market. Since about 2004, restaurants and coffee shops have grown, and now even the back street is named &quot;Pub Street Allty &quot;. From about 16:00, backpackers or group tourists and other nationalities of foreign travelers began to gather here, in order to attract foreign guests, each store has high-play background music, each store neon and interior, table furnishings, etc. are very thoughtful, creating a gorgeous world. In Bar Street, there is a bar that is a must-visit place for many tourists to Siem Reap. It is the Red Piano Bar, because Angelina Jolie was filming &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; in Siem Reap for dinner, and personally adjusted a cup of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; cocktail at the bar. Let the red piano bar be famous for this, so that many people admire this dining. 17\uff1a00-19\uff1a00 is the &quot;Happy Hour&quot; of the Red Piano every day. At this time, you can get a free drink or Angkor beer for a main course. In addition, if you are lucky, you can get a free order for the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; of the multiple of 10. We have friends who get the free order. If it was a 500 multiplex, Tomb Raider would get $100 and a red piano bar T-shirt.",

The pork side dish has the taste of lard residue as a child, very fragrant. The material is flat, suitable for Chinese tastes, paella is really delicious, the six of us are still discussing whether to add an additional one, fried chicken is on the market, although the price is 15 knives small, but the taste is really good, with lemon juice sweet and salty crispy, the taste can be black pepper, Six people 160,000 (about 40 knives, tipping, satisfied with return) the only downside is that the flies are always very persistent to have lunch with us",

But if you let me say the restaurant that you can&#39;t miss the most, it&#39;s not The Rock Restaurant . \ud83c\udf0a Unique Location \ud83c\udf0a This restaurant, known as the world&#39;s loneliest restaurant, is very eye-catching in its location alone it is built on a rock, located in the blue Atlantic Ocean, with the world&#39;s most invincible 360-degree sea view! This unique geographical location has made it one of the symbols of Zanzibar Island, and it has also become a must-see place for Internet celebrities around the world. How should guests reach the restaurant when they choose such a &quot;lonely&quot; location? Interestingly, the way to go will vary according to the high tide or low tide, when the water level is lowered, the road to the restaurant will be exposed naked, and the restaurant will also spread sandbags on the bare road, then you can walk directly from the beach to The Rock. At high tide, the restaurant arranges boats to pick up guests, and of course, if you want, no one will stop you. I was on the boat when I went, and the boatman on the restaurant side was not so much a rower, but rather a boater, who pulled us over. \ud83c\udfda Restaurant Landscape \ud83c\udfdaThe Rock2010 began construction and officially opened in 2012. The decoration style is the original ecological style with local characteristics. The restaurant has 12 tables, which can allow up to 45 people to eat at the same time. Here you can choose to enjoy a seafood meal indoors or sit on an outdoor sofa and enjoy Zanzibar&rsquo;s priceless treasuresthe colorful, invincible sea view that hits the heart. Listening to the waves, the sea breeze is blowing, surrounded by the blue and green sea, the mouth is enjoying a fresh seafood feast, try to ask, is there anything more dreamy than this?",

Special places are coffee ice cubes, but many domestic cafes have this practice. Coffee ice cubes should not be made of espresso, milk poured in until the ice melts, still light and tasteless. Friends&#39; hand-made coffee is also ordinary. Cake recommends royal chocolate cake, like caramel bottoms. The price is cheap, if you want to blow the air-conditioning for a little sit, this is a good choice.",

The speciality is a coconut ball with jackfruit, coconut cream and ice cream. The Australian lung fish yellow curry and spicy cocktail are also great. Just wish we had better photos to show how amazing the food is. I also wish I remembered the name of the lady waiter because she was great and friendly.

I ordered the meat burger, it was really delicious, the bread was fresh and tasted very good, and there was a great big meat patty inside, which was difficult to meet in Southeast Asia. My girlfriend ordered seafood, a big one and very delicious! The staff here are very friendly and we love the local Asian cuisine, but it is a nice place to switch our tastes and not eat Asian cuisine for the time being.",

You won&rsquo;t be disappointed. I love the way they make coffee with small vortex-shaped mixing sticks. I ate so much food here in the last four days!! I just didn&rsquo;t eat enough.

The environment of this store is very good, the restaurant is large, there is free hot water and ice water to drink. Tonight, I went to the restaurant with the girl in the same room. I ordered a vegetarian beef noodles. It was too salty. The noodles inside were convenient. The iron noodles that I didn&#39;t order last time were delicious.",

The skin of the fried spring rolls is crispy and crispy, and the sauce of the fried fish is very fragrant and sweet. Two soups, one on the list, one strong. The strong one saw for the first time, called Cambodian brother soup, the taste of curry, or the fragrance of various spices. Not salty, no MSG. The waiter does not speak Chinese, but the English is fluent and the pronunciation is very good, so the communication is particularly smooth. Also recommended. I ordered two of them recommended by girls. In general, a great value store, delicious and cheap. Not far from the night market, it is convenient to walk over.",

The egg rolls were crispy and delicious, wrapped in sweet sauce, and the Cambodian desserts on the end were completely inconsistent with the picture, and some ingredients were later added.

The restaurant is basically no other guests. The handsome guy at the door speaks Chinese very well and greets us very warmly. The dishes here are basically suitable for our Chinese stomach, very satisfied, especially the fish, not very delicious, but you can eat Chinese taste!

I ordered a fried noodles and actually fried with steel wires. I called the boss to come over. The indifferent attitude made me know that this happened for a long time...

For us, the restaurant was large with lots of tables and spotlights. It made us feel uncomfortable that the whole restaurant was bright. In short, we didn&#39;t order anything in the tank at the end because it was too expensive. We ordered from the menu: cold hot and sour oysters, fried pretzels and fried asparagus. They were all fresh and delicious. In such a big place, I feel very slow at night, so the service stays too much and it is not very comfortable. But I still have to say that this meal is good and we enjoy it.",

Pink yellow and pink yarn, semi-circular wooden windowsills, white tablecloths and green flowers on the table, it is not enough to say how exquisite but the details are OK. The fusion dish is provided, and the supply time is 17-22, and you should be able to eat late at night. Southeast Asian dishes are fusion of some Western dishes, such as Spanish tapas, French fries, fruit salad, Khmer local traditional specialties amok, and various curry flavors. Shake, fruit flavor, mango and banana two flavors I prefer, Southeast Asian flavor is strong, mango is still more sweet and refreshing. Mango salad, is a more raw mango cut, plus salted fish and Hawaiian fruit, refreshing appetizer, not the same as the imagined mango salad, more like papaya salad. Spring rolls are very Chinese, fried goods, but the inside is mainly vegetarian, there are carrots I like. The seasonal fruit platter is relatively simple, with dragon fruit, bananas, and mangoes. The mango is very sweet. spaghetti pesto Italian green sauce is thick, and garlic slices are sprinkled with a lot of parmesan cheese. The original price is about 31 knives, and I met a discount day. Hehe, very good, half price!",

Each meat has a special label to let customers know, which is very interesting. Shark meat is not much different from other fish.

I booked a seat online, but when I arrived at the scene they told me that there was no our name! Anyway, they helped us find a table in front of the front desk. The buffet starts at 7pm and the performance starts at 7.45pm and lasts an hour. We have been to other cultural dance shows in Asia and this is the best. The food in the buffet was great, there were several cooking stations that would make your food very fresh, and unfortunately there were 20 people in the restaurant that night. There are so many excellent restaurants in Siem Reap that obviously the price increases here are effective and you will miss a night of enjoyment if you don&#39;t come here to try it.",

The environment is really great. The place is very secret. I originally wanted to live in Anlu, but my companion was too expensive. I was only willing to come to eat. It was a pity. Anqi is really my favorite style, low-key and luxurious. This time I communicated the menu in the mail in advance. It was very powerful. The food was very creative and tasted good, but the dishes were not particularly amazing. I can only say that it is quite satisfactory. Everything is very smooth. I also ordered red wine and white wine. The service is particularly thoughtful! There is basically no problem with English communication!",

After watching the sunrise the next day, let the driver bring it over. At seven o&#39;clock in the evening, there were not many people, because it was raining, I sat in a row of positions facing the street. I ordered a pork chop, a curry beef, and the driver ordered a Khmer traditional sour soup, all with white rice, enough rice. The curry beef is delicious, the soup tastes very strong, not very spicy, and the bibimbap is superb. Traditional soup with fish, vegetables, slightly sour, appetizer is particularly suitable, especially in such hot weather. The pork chops are nothing special, but tender.",

Choose a Set for one person, $25. . . Smilk. . . Ordered an extra cup of strawberry juice shake, it is not possible to renew the cup. The drinks in the set can be refilled, there are tea and coffee options. The 2 girls shared one person just right, and we all ate it. The three-layer HIGH TEA that came up was very large, with Cambodian and Western styles, and the coffee tasted very mellow. I just want to say that I earn it, every small snack is exquisite. In the end, the remaining English muffins were not finished, and the others were all dried up. There were basically no people in the afternoon, and the guests were all foreign tourists. Service beckons must come. The place to make a simple meal is delicious, three balls, coconut flavor, chocolate, matcha Hawaiian nuts, 2 dollars a ball is very close to the people. The coconut taste is the best ice cream I have ever eaten in the local area. It feels like it is made with pure fresh coconut juice, the chocolate is rich, and the matcha tastes mellow.",

        "comment": "Cambodian food is recommended, the first meal of the super delicious Cambodian hot pot in every place is the first impression of this city. It seems that encountering appetizing food in a foreign country is more than anything. The first night I arrived in Siem Reap, I went to eat a Cambodian hot pot recommended by my friends. As a girl who likes to eat hot pot, I was really surprised by this authentic Cambodian hot pot. \ud83d\udd38 Eating method: Cambodian hot pot is different from Sichuan hot pot and copper hot pot that we often eat in China, but is more similar to Thai hot pot. The middle is a raised barbecue part of the barbecue, and the surrounding area is poured water to cook vegetables. This is more similar to the &quot;water fried meat&quot; that we often eat in China. \ud83d\udca1 The locals call this hot pot: &quot;Niu Shangshan&quot; hot pot, which is quite apt \uff5e\ud83d\udd38 dishes: What is more surprising is that the variety of Siem Reap dishes is quite complete, all kinds of vegetables are complete, as well as golden needle mushrooms, apricot mushrooms, green peppers, sweet potatoes, etc. It is not easy to know that you want to eat rich vegetables abroad. \u2757\ufe0f Super recommended beef! The beef is wrapped in a layer of eggs. After roasting on a roasting tray, it is really delicious. In addition to beef, pork and so on are also very good. \u25bb Very interesting is that the hot pot package here also includes instant noodles, I feel very kind and grounded, and then the food is very fragrant and haha \uff5e\ud83d\udd38 The focus is on their home marinade, the taste is not strange, and the unexpected compound Chinese taste, sour and hot and hot like it very much. In chatting with the boss, I learned that his family&#39;s marinade was made by his mother. It should be regarded as their &quot;secret recipe&quot;. In addition to hot pot barbecue, this store also has Chinese and Cambodian meals to choose from. \u2763\ufe0f Service: The store owner is very friendly and likes the Chinese very much. I really want to sigh that Cambodia is really a very friendly country to China. The boss and waiter will worry about helping to order food, barbecue, etc. throughout the whole process. The whole experience is still great. \u2763\ufe0f Store name: TASTE OF KHMER SOUP&amp;BBQ, just search directly in Google Maps.",

The barbecue area next to the restaurant is very lively. The iron Internet is full of pork in the roasted bamboo shoots, which is full of oil. I didn&#39;t find the Cambodian hot pot I wanted to eat, so I immediately turned around and entered the store. One reason for liking Korean food is that it will give a lot of side dishes, so that the table looks very rich, this one is particularly exaggerated. Quite satisfied with a lunch.",

Walking distance from the old market, so I can go shopping at any time at night, and various restaurants are available. 2. Nearby hotels can rent bicycles. Although the idea of renting a bicycle was abandoned because the weather was too hot, I felt that this place was still good: free breakfast coffee juice fruit, the front desk patiently provided a variety of travel information, from car rental to booking, very patient, never showed impatience (We are a little impatient because of the communication, a little impatient, really embarrassed), free drinking water, clean and tidy rooms, air conditioning and cooling are also very good. The fly in the ointment is that it is close to the street. If you sleep badly, don&#39;t book here. A small swimming pool on the roof, symbolism is greater than substance, too shallow and too small to swim.",

It was really a relief; there were green peppers in the scrambled eggs with tomatoes; and the potato shreds were in place. The sauerkraut fish is really great! The price is moderate and the Chinese flavor is full. I only found such a family in Siem Reap, but the dumplings I went to eat for the second time seemed to have a butter smell, not as pure as the first pork onion. In short, it is much better than the local dishes in Siem Reap!",

The young boss lacks basic politeness! 10 minutes after the wrong dish, I found out that I brought it directly from someone else&#39;s table and put it on our table. There was no apology or even explanation! The compatriot sat at 3 tables and waited quietly. He was busy and ignored. The old foreigner immediately greeted him with a smile. He served food before us! I understand that foreigners will tip, but do you still expect tips for services like this to your compatriots? I forgot what blood is flowing in my blood vessels! The price of the dish is more expensive than the average Cambodian meal, and the taste is not as close to Chinese food as Chinese food. Why can&#39;t the bad review yesterday be issued? Do more compatriots be fooled by restaurants that treat their compatriots like this? Shouldn&#39;t compatriots be allowed to know?",

The service is very good, the environment and decoration are very good. The seafood soup is quite good. The main dish needs to put some more sauces because it feels a bit dry to eat.

        "comment": "gelato has a shop at the end of the bar street. The first glance that is attracted by it must be European-style lazy decoration. It is very simple and slightly retro atmosphere. It naturally attracts many European and American guests to patronize the ice cream here. It is more famous. There are disk-shaped combinations and a simple ball. The price is really too affordable. In order to try several flavors, Xia Mo ordered a banana boat and three single balls. The waiter sister shook her head and said to me: too much \uff5e Haha, I know it too. The banana boat is so big that it is equivalent to a three-color ice cream with Luxury before, and it is also strawberry, vanilla and chocolate. The four flavors of the single ball are very good, but there are cookies in stracciatella, which is more fragrant; Strawberry, passion fruit taste like Xueba, sour and sweet, especially refreshing; the pistachio taste is my first time to try, I feel that I don&#39;t have the aroma of the fruit in my imagination.

There are no people in the store. The waiter and the guest are 1:1 ratio. 3. The waiter seems to be behind the spirit. I eat and write a review. The waiter is standing behind it, very uncomfortable. 4. It is expensive here. A bowl of ordinary North Korean cold noodles costs $ 7, enough for me to eat two stir-fried dishes in a local restaurant. 5. The taste is not very tasty. To be honest, it is really not as good as the cold noodle restaurant at the entrance of Shanghai Normal University.",
