In fact, each shopping mall has its own advantages and characteristics, so it can&#39;t say which is good, which is not good, that is too general. Its location is also relatively superior, all in the bustling area of the city center. The environment here is still good, there is no pollution, so it is still worth you to see and open your eyes.
